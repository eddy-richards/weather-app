# weather-app
This Weather App is a full-stack project built with ReactJS on the frontend and NestJS on the backend. The application allows users to enter a city name and retrieve the current weather information, including temperature and weather conditions. The backend fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and serves it to the frontend.
